## Requirements

#### Hardware
* OS: Windows (only CPU supported currently) or any Linux based operating system. If you want to run this on macOS you have to follow the steps in build from source in order to create the installer. This is untested since I don't currently own a Mac.
* Graphics: NVIDIA GPU with [CUDA support](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) is highly recommended, you can train on CPU otherwise but it will take days if not weeks.
* RAM: 8GB of RAM, you can try with less but it may not work.

#### Software
* Docker, you can [download it here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you are on Linux, it is advised to install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) instead of Docker Desktop, as Docker Desktop likes to make the world complicated.

## How to install

1. Download the latest installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/dunky11/voicesmith/releases).
2. Double click to run the installer.
