## What is text normalization?

Text to speech models can only process spelled out text, for example most models have no way
of learning how to map numbers to speech. Since most text from the real world isn't spelled out it's crucial
to normalize it before training the model on it.

Text normalization for TTS (text-to-speech) mainly includes the following steps:

1. Spelling out **numbers**:

- 512 days. -> Five hundred twelve days.
- She danced until 3 o'clock. -> She until at three o'clock.

2. Spelling out **dates**:

- October 6, 2018. -> October sixth, twenty-eighteen.
- 22 March 2007. -> the twenty-second of March two thousand and seven.

3. Spelling out **abbreviations**:

- I will come ASAP. -> I will come as soon as possible.
- Mr. Smith is not here today -> Mister Smith is not here today.

4. Spelling out **symbols**:

- He only gave 30%, it was terrible. -> He only gave thirty percent, it was terrible.
- Let's meet after Q & A. -> Let's meet after Q and A.

5. Spelling out **initialisms**:

- He watched TV all day. -> He watched T V all day.
- The FBI is already investigating her. -> The F B I is already investigating her.

6. **Replacing uncommon symbols** by more commonly used ones:

- He said he “knew it all”. -> He said he "knew it all".
- Micheal, hurry up… -> Micheal, hurry up...

VoiceSmith can automatically apply above transformations on your datasets. **Steps 1-5 are language
specific** and currently only work on english, german, spanish and russian speakers.
**Step 6 is not language** specific and works on all languages.

## How to normalize a dataset

### Creating a text normalization run

In order to normalize a dataset you have to create a new text normalization run. Click on
"Preprocessing" in the navigation and then click on "New Text Normalization Run". Afterwards
click on "select" on the right side of the newly created run. The process of text normalization
is split into three steps:

### Configuration

Here you can configure your text normalization run. Current configuration options include:

| Name    | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name    | Name used for identification purposes, is arbitrary.                                                                                                                                |
| Dataset | Dataset to normalize, if a dataset is greyed out is already referenced by a run. If you haven't imported a dataset yet check out [Importing a dataset](/usage/importing-a-dataset). |

### Preprocessing

After you have configured the text normalization run it's waiting time. Depending on the dataset size this can take minutes to hours.

### Pick Samples

Here a table is shown of all samples that will be normalized. The table has the following columns:

| Column   | Description                                                                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Old Text | Text before normalization.                                                                                                                 |
| New Text | Text after normalization, the text of the sample will be changed to this value. You can edit this by clicking on the pen next to the text. |
| Reason   | The reason(s) why the sample will be normalized.                                                                                           |

It is advised to at least skim through the table as automatic text normalization is not perfect. If there are samples which you don't want to be normalized,
you can select them using the checkboxes on the left and then click on "Do not normalize selected". Those samples will stay in the dataset but will not be normalized.

If you are happy with the list of normalizations to apply you can click on "Next".
Now the samples in your dataset will be changed according to transformations in the table. VoiceSmith may freeze for a little,
depending on the number of normalizations in the table. This is currently the expected behaviour.
