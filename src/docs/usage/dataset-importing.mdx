title: Importing a dataset
description: Learn how to import a dataset into VoiceSmith.

The first thing you should do is import a dataset into VoiceSmith. VoiceSmith requires your dataset
to follow a specific pattern; each speaker is represented by a folder whose name is the speaker's name.
The folder contains the samples of the speaker. Each sample consists of one audio and one text file.
Both audio and text files have to have the same name. In the .txt files you write the transcription
of the audio file. Below is an example of a correctly formatted dataset containing two speakers with two samples each.
As you can see, supported audio extensions are .flac and .wav:

```
.
└── The Simpsons <- this folder represents the dataset name
    └── Homer Simpson <- this folder represents the first speaker's name
        ├── dF4mNcv1.wav <- this file is the audio part of the first sample of the speaker "Homer Simpson"
        ├── dF4mNcv1.txt <- this file is the text part of the first sample of the speaker "Homer Simpson"
        ├── M0J6zoHw.flac
        ├── M0J6zoHw.txt
        └── ...
    └── Bart Simpson <- this folder represents the second speaker's name
        ├── v1jo6jh.wav
        ├── v1jo6jh.txt
        ├── M0J6zoHw.flac
        ├── M0J6zoHw.txt
        └── ...
    ...
```

The audio files can be sampled at any sampling rate as they will be resampled later. However,
to achieve the best possible quality, it is recommended to have a sampling rate of at least 22.05khz.

VoiceSmith can preprocess and train on both single and multi-speaker datasets. You can also
import datasets with speakers who speak different languages. Remember that while you can have
speakers who speak different languages in your dataset, each speaker should speak only one language.
If you have English and Spanish audio of Homer Simpson, for example, you should create two
speakers and name them "Homer Simpson (English)" and "Homer Simpson (Spanish)."

Let's say we want to create the dataset above. First, click on "Datasets" in the Navigation and
then click on "Create Empty Dataset." Click on the pen next to the created datasets name to give
your dataset a name, let's call it "The Simpsons".

Now we have to add Speakers to our dataset. To do that, click on "select" on the right side of the table.
Then click on "Add Speakers From Folder." Finally, select the language of the speakers you want to add to the dataset
from the dropdown and click on "Pick Speakers."

As described in the graphic above, each speaker is represented by a folder, so we will select the
folders named "Homer Simpson" and "Bart Simpson." You can import multiple speakers at once by first left-clicking
on one folder and then shift+left clicking on another folder. Click on "Open" to confirm the selection.

The speakers and their samples will now be imported into the software. Depending on the number of text-audio pairs,
this can take multiple minutes.

If your imported dataset is noisy, it can now be cleaned up by VoiceSmith's automatic dataset preprocessing tools.
While they can improve the quality of the final voices, using those tools is optional, and their usefulness
depends on your dataset. Next we will explain the preprocessing tools:
["Text Normalization"](/usage/text-normalization), ["Sample Splitting"](/usage/sample-splitting)
and ["Dataset Cleaning"](/usage/dataset-cleaning).
You can also skip them and jump straight ahead to ["Training"](/usage/training) in order to clone the
voices of the speakers in your dataset.
