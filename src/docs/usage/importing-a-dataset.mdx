description: Learn how to import a dataset into VoiceSmith.

The first thing you should do is to import a dataset into VoiceSmith. VoiceSmith requires your dataset
to follow a certain pattern. Each speaker is represented by a folder whose name is the speaker's name.
The folder contains the samples of the speaker. Each sample consists of one audio and one text file.
Both audio and text files have to have the same name. In the .txt files you simply write the transcription
of the audio file. Below is an example of a correctly formatted dataset that contains two speakers
with two samples each. As you can see supported audio extensions are .flac and .wav:

```
.
└── The Simpsons <- this folder represents the dataset name
    └── Homer Simpson <- this folder represents the first speakers name
        ├── dF4mNcv1.wav <- this file is the audio part of the first sample of the speaker "Homer Simpson"
        ├── dF4mNcv1.txt <- this file is the text part of the first sample of the speaker "Homer Simpson"
        ├── M0J6zoHw.flac
        ├── M0J6zoHw.txt
        └── ...
    └── Bart Simpson <- this folder represents the second speakers name
        ├── v1jo6jh.wav
        ├── v1jo6jh.txt
        ├── M0J6zoHw.flac
        ├── M0J6zoHw.txt
        └── ...
    ...
```

The audio files can be sampled at any sampling rate as they will be resampled later. However, for best audio
quality, it is recommended to have a sampling rate of at least 22.05khz.

VoiceSmith can preprocess and train on dataset which contain only on or multiple speakers. You can also
import datasets with speakers who speak different languages. Keep in mind that while you can have different
speakers who speak different languages in your dataset each speaker should speak only one language. If you
have audio of Homer Simpson who speaks english and spanish you should create two speakers and name
them for example "Homer Simpson (english)" and "Homer Simpson (spanish)".

Let's say we want to create the dataset above.

## Example

```mdx

title: "My Example"

disableTableOfContents: false

Wow, this is a nice page
```

## Embedding files

In a documentation website, sometimes you will need to embed well known services (like CodeSandbox, Twitter, or others...). If you need to
do it, you can simply copy-paste the link (powered by the awesome [gatsby-remark-embeder](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/packages/gatsby-remark-embedder/)).
Make sure to check the [supported services](https://github.com/MichaelDeBoey/gatsby-remark-embedder#supported-services).

## Code Highlight

We support many options for code components.

### Title

To show a title, just add it to your code block. Ex: `title=src/myfile.css`

```css title=src/myfile.css
.gatsby::before {
  content: "niceee...";
}
```

### Line numbers

To add line numbers for that code block, pass an option `lineNumbers=true`.

```js lineNumbers=true
const rocket = {
  launch: () => console.log("Launching..."),
};

rocket.launch();
```

### React live

As mentioned in the introduction, this theme uses `react-live`, so you can
create a playground for live editing React components.

To use it, just add a `live=true` option to your code block.

```jsx lineNumbers=true title=gatsby-config.js live=true
function MyComponent() {
  function handleButtonClick() {
    alert("wowww");
  }

  return <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Hey, click me!</button>;
}

render(<MyComponent />);
```

> If you need to add elements to the scope, check this [guide](/usage/shadowing#adding-elements-to-react-live-scope).

### Highlight lines

To highlight lines, you can pass ranges to a `highlight` option.
For example `highlight={1-4,6-7,9}` on the code below would result in:

```jsx highlight={1-4,6-7,9}
function MyComponent() {
  function handleButtonClick() {
    alert("wowww");
  }

  return <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Hey, click me!</button>;
}

render(<MyComponent />);
```
