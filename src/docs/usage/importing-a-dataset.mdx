The first thing you should do is to import a dataset into VoiceSmith. VoiceSmith requires your dataset
to follow a certain pattern. Each speaker is represented by a folder whose name is the speaker's name.
The folder contains the samples of the speaker. Each sample consists of one audio and one text file.
Both audio and text files have to have the same name. In the .txt files you simply write the transcription
of the audio file. Below is an example of a correctly formatted dataset that contains two speakers
with two samples each. As you can see supported audio extensions are .flac and .wav:

```
.
└── The Simpsons <- this folder represents the dataset name
    └── Homer Simpson <- this folder represents the first speakers name
        ├── dF4mNcv1.wav <- this file is the audio part of the first sample of the speaker "Homer Simpson"
        ├── dF4mNcv1.txt <- this file is the text part of the first sample of the speaker "Homer Simpson"
        ├── M0J6zoHw.flac
        ├── M0J6zoHw.txt
        └── ...
    └── Bart Simpson <- this folder represents the second speakers name
        ├── v1jo6jh.wav
        ├── v1jo6jh.txt
        ├── M0J6zoHw.flac
        ├── M0J6zoHw.txt
        └── ...
    ...
```

The audio files can be sampled at any sampling rate as they will be resampled later. However, for best audio
quality, it is recommended to have a sampling rate of at least 22.05khz.

VoiceSmith can preprocess and train on dataset which contain only on or multiple speakers. You can also
import datasets with speakers who speak different languages. Keep in mind that while you can have different
speakers who speak different languages in your dataset each speaker should speak only one language. If you
have audio of Homer Simpson who speaks english and spanish you should create two speakers and name
them for example "Homer Simpson (english)" and "Homer Simpson (spanish)".

Let's say we want to create the dataset above. First click on "Datasets" in the Navigation and
then click on "Create Empty Dataset". Click on the pen next to the created datasets name to give
your dataset a name, lets call it "The Simpsons".

import { TestImage } from "../../components/images";

Next we have to add Speakers to our dataset. To do that click on "select" on right side in the table.
Then click on "Add Speakers From Folder". Select the language of the speakers you want to add to the dataset
from the dropdown and click on "Pick Speakers".

As described in the graphic above each speaker is represented by a folder, so we will select both the
folders named "Homer Simpson" and "Bart Simpson". You can add multiple speakers at once by first left-clicking
on one folder and then shift+left clicking on another folder. Click on "Open" to confirm the selection.

The speakers and their samples will now imported into the software. Depending on the number of text-audio pairs
this can take multiple minutes.

If your imported dataset is noisy it can now be cleaned up by VoiceSmiths automatic dataset preprocessing tools.
While they can improve the quality of the final voices, using those tools is optional and their usefulness
depends on your dataset. Next we will exlain the three preprocessing tools:
"Text Normalization", "Sample Splitting" and "Dataset Cleaning". You can also skip them and jump straight ahead
to "Training" in order to clone the voices of the speakers in your dataset.
