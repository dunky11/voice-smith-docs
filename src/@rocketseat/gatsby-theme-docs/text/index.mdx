# Introduction

VoiceSmith makes training text-to-speech models easy. It lets you fine-tune a
120 million parameter beefed-up version of DelightfulTTS on your dataset. The model was
pretrained on a proprietary multilingual dataset containing over 8000 speakers.
It also provides tools commonly used to preprocess text-to-speech datasets.

## Features

- Solid text-to-speech pipeline based on DelightfulTTS and UnivNet, always kept up to date
- Pretrained on a proprietary dataset containing 8000+ speakers in 5 languages
- Supports training in 14 languages out of the box
- Works both for single-speaker and multi-speaker models
- Support for code-switching - train in one language, talk in another one
- Battle-tested on large datasets containing millions of samples
- Highly optimized inference using torchserve
- Controllability through the option to use SSML
- Tools to automatically improve the quality of your datasets
