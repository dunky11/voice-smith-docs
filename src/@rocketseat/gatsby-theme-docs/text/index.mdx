# Introduction

VoiceSmith makes training text-to-speech models easy. It lets you fine-tune a 
120 million parameter beefed-up version of DelightfulTTS on your dataset. The model was 
pretrained on a proprietary multilingual dataset containing over 8000 speakers.
It also provides tools commonly used to preprocess text-to-speech datasets.
